# ATreeDemo  
  
Tried some tree structure things. but nothing is done yet.  

# HuntHighLightBackUper  

Once Upon a Time, there is a game called Hunt : Showdown.  
sadly it has no function to automatically save highlights.  
so I made it.  

1. even if it has a big name it actually is a program that simply copy files from here to another location  
2. at least it has a thread that scans target location if a new file appears  


# OnScreenReticle  

In some games, they do not provide a in-game reticle or an insufficient reticle in FPS.  
this is outrageous  
thats why it is born. 

1. it is just a simple top-most trensparent window with some convenient features.  
2. because it is a "window" it does not work on full-screen mode
